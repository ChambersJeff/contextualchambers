          <h3 class="h2">The Path to Chambers Strategy & Co.</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve always been fascinated by big ideas and the people who make them happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in Connecticut and graduated cum laude from Amherst College, where I honed my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. My early career took me around the world, exposing me to different cultures, industries, and economic systems. When I returned to the U.S., I completed my Master’s in International Politics and Business at NYU, eager to bridge the gap between global policy, innovation, and strategic partnerships.
          </p>
          <p>
            My first role out of graduate school landed me at the World Economic Forum (WEF) — an unparalleled environment where I worked directly with CEOs of companies like Moderna Therapeutics, Lyft, and Airbnb. Together, we navigated the intersection of policy, technology, and industry disruption. Over the years, I learned from some of the most influential leaders in the world, developing a deep understanding of how businesses grow, pivot, and collaborate to shape the future.

    <!-- Two-Column Row for Building Systems and Why I Started -->

        <!-- Building Systems for Innovation -->

          <div class="box-section d-flex flex-column h-100">
            <h3 class="h2">Building Systems for Innovation</h3>
            <p>
              Leaving the World Economic Forum marked a turning point in my career. I wanted to move beyond established institutions and into spaces where ideas moved fast, and impact was immediate. Startups offered that challenge—where strategy had to become action, and structure needed to be built from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
              At The Commons Project, I helped launch CommonPass, an internationally verifiable digital health pass, tackling the complexities of global mobility during COVID-19. It was a crash course in innovation under pressure, working across governments and industries to solve real-world challenges in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
              From there, I joined Pursuit, a mission-driven workforce development organization, where I reshaped the approach to philanthropy and partnerships. By rethinking strategy and streamlining operations, I helped lay the groundwork for long-term sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through it all, I’ve stayed focused on the same core challenge—building smart systems that turn ambitious ideas into reality.
            </p>

        <!-- Why I Started Chambers Strategy & Co. -->
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div class="box-section d-flex flex-column h-100">
            <h3 class="h2">Why I Started Chambers Strategy & Co.</h3>
            <p>
              Through these experiences, I saw a common challenge: organizations have the vision, but often lack the systems, partnerships, and funding strategies to execute at scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s why I founded Chambers Strategy & Co. — to help businesses and nonprofits bridge the gap between potential and execution. My approach is deeply strategic, context-driven, and technology-enhanced. I don’t just advise; I build real, scalable solutions that drive funding growth, operational efficiency, and high-value partnerships.

      <p>I specialize in working with:</p>
      <ul>

        <li><span>Industry Innovators –</span> Businesses at the cutting edge of technology, workforce development, and global policy.</li>
        <li><span>Leaders Who Think Big –</span> Executives and entrepreneurs who want to move beyond surface-level solutions and implement strategies that create lasting impact.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My approach is built on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Strategic Insight –</span> Decoding complex industries to identify opportunities others miss.</li>
        <li><span>AI-Powered Automation –</span> Using technology to eliminate inefficiencies and maximize output.</li>

      <h3 class="h2">Beyond Work</h3>
      <p>
        When I’m not helping organizations unlock growth and scale their impact, I’m exploring New York City, experimenting with urban gardening on my balcony, or getting lost in the world of Star Trek. I’ve called Jackson Heights home for over a decade, drawn to its energy, diversity, and incredible food.
